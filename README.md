# Online-payment-fraud-detection-ML-project

This project contains of 7 main steps -  
1. Data Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. EDA on transformed Data (Feature Engineering broadly starts here)
4. Advance Feature Engineering
5. Final Visualization
6. Model Preparation (Here Logistic Regression Model)
7. Model Building and Evaluation

Currently at the midpoint of the project, I have successfully completed and uploaded the data preparation and visualization modules.  

  
*EDIT* (29 JUN 2025) - Developed and evaluated three machine learning models—XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest—to determine which achieves the highest accuracy for the given task.
